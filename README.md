## My Favorite Series/Movies
1. Gossip Girl 
- This show is my most favorite series because it shows the reality of how social media can take over and run people's lives.
- This is also about privileged teens living on the Upper East Side of New York can hide no secret from the ruthless blogger who is always watching. 
- In the show Gossip Girl many different themes are also portrayed, but the ones that stand out are loyalty, drugs/drinking, and how wealth corrupts people.
