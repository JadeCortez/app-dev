## My Favorite Series/Movies
1. ** Gossip Girl **
- This show is my most favorite series because it shows the reality of how social media can take over and run people's lives.
- This is also about privileged teens living on the Upper East Side of New York can hide no secret from the ruthless blogger who is always watching. 
- In the show Gossip Girl many different themes are also portrayed, but the ones that stand out are loyalty, drugs/drinking, and how wealth corrupts people. All of these themes are shown through teenagers in the show. These themes go on farther to be represented in the world today through teenagers and even adults.
